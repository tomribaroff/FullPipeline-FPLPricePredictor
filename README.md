<h3 align="center">FPL Price Change Batch Predicition</h3>

  <p align="center">
    A full end-to-end batch prediction pipeline. Built to predict price changes to players in the Fantasy Premier League (FPL) Football Game. If individual players in your team are set to change price, the pipeline will email you notification of this before it happens overnight, to allow you to adjust your transfer strategy accordingly.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was built both as an educational exercise for the author, but more importantly, to solve the issue of missing price changes for users on the FPL game.

This issue occurs often in FPL - a user might wish to buy or sell a player, but find that they may no longer be able to afford their planned tranfers. A player starts the game with Â£100m budget, and must plan transfers of players into their team accordingly.

Player's price changes occur overnight (GMT) and thus a 6pm GMT warning in advance of predicted price changes is a useful tool.
